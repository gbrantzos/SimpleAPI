Simple REST API sample over a CRUD application to "gather" best practices and techniques. It should be based on
- Minimal API
- EF Core
- MediatR

To be used as an example and/or as a starting point to begin a new project.

It is also an attempt to start practising TDD, even in simple CRUD applications.
